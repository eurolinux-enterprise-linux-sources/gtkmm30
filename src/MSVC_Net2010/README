Building gtkmm-2.4 with Visual Studio 2010

* You will need Visual Studio 2010 (MSVC 10.0). See the MSVC_Net2005/ folder if you want to build gtkmm with Visual Studio .NET 2005, or the MSVC_Net2008/ folder if you want to build gtkmm with Visual Studio .NET 2008. Earlier versions of the compiler, including 6.0, 7.0 and 7.1 will not work.
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+
* Build libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm and pangomm from source.
* Add GTK+, libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm and apngomm to the include and lib paths in Visual Studio.
* Load the MSVC_Net2010/gtkmm.sln solution.
* Build the entire solution.
* Run the tests.
